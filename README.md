### Project Details:
Simplest Python web scrapper, to :
- Fetch all the notifications appearing on my University website
- Saving them as text file (parameters saved : Date, Title, PDF link) 
- Downloading Circulars posted by the University in Local Machine.

#### Need for this:
It was a tedious task for me to go to the website and check for any updates during quarantine period.

#### More
- Playing with my University website from dev tools, I observed that each notifications share some common attributes. Using these to fetch only notifications from the site.
- The pdfs are stored in the Data/ folder.

### Todos:
- [x] Run via shell script
- [ ] Add robust try-catch blocks
- [ ] Add logging instead of printing
- [ ] Add Mail Function - To mail only the updates
