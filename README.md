This Program was developed by me when we were in lockdown and each day I have to  go to the University website to see if there's any update.

This program fetches all the latest notifications from my universities website and saves them in a text file, and then fetches all the pdf files for this notifications.


In the Text file, Notification Date, Title and Notification url are saved.
This text file opens automatically after the program fetches all the information and stores it in the file.


After this, The program starts fetching all the pdfs related to theses notifications, hosted by the website.

These pdfs are stored in the Data/ folder.

* Todo:
** Add robust try-catch blocks
** Add logging instead of pringint
